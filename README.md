# ruuvi.nrf5_sdk15_bootloader.c
Source code for Nordic Semiconductor SDK15 / Softdevice 6.1.0 bootloaders used by Ruuvi.
The project is essentially nRF5 SDK15.2 `secure_bluetooth` examples with a few configuration constants and naming changed.

*Note* The start address of flash is 0x75000 to maintain compatibility with RuuviTag 12.3 bootloader. SDK debug example ships with 0x72000 and production ships with 0x78000.
Some logging has been disabled to clear up the space. 

# Setting up the project
Download [Nordic Semiconductor SDK 15.2]() and unzip at the same level as this git repository, i.e.

- nrf_sdk15.2
- ruuvi.nrf5_sdk15_bootloader.c

# Compiling
The project can be compiled with [Segger Embedded Studio](https://www.segger.com/).

Select debug version in build options to skip version checks on upload, or generate your own keypair with:
```
nrfutil keys generate private.pem
nrfutil keys display --key pk --format code private.pem
```

and use production version. By default Ruuvi's `ruuvi_open_private.pem` signing key is used, which means
that anyone can create a package for your device.

# Usage
Flash the bootloader and Softdevice s132 6.1.0 to RuuviTag.

# License
Project is under the nRF5_Nordic_license.txt
